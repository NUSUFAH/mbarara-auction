# Mbarara Online Auction System

Web-based auction platform for transparent bidding and price discovery in
Mbarara City. Built with Django + PostgreSQL, per the multi-phase System
Analysis & Design Specification (Phases 1-2, delivered separately as Word
documents) that this codebase implements.

## Project status

This repository currently implements **Phases 3-8**: Django Foundation,
Users/Roles, Auction Management (listings, categories, images, approval
workflow, lifecycle state machine), the Bidding Engine (concurrency-safe
bid placement, privacy-preserving bid history, automated closing & winner
determination), Notifications (in-app inbox with async delivery
plumbing), and Payments (status tracking only — no real gateway).

- [x] Project scaffold & modular app structure (`apps/*`)
- [x] Settings split: `base` / `development` / `testing` / `production`
- [x] PostgreSQL wired via `DATABASE_URL` (no hard-coded credentials)
- [x] Custom `User` model with role field (accounts app)
- [x] Registration, login, logout, password reset/change
- [x] Base templates (Bootstrap 5) + audit-log scaffolding
- [x] `SellerProfile` / `BidderProfile` models, auto-created on registration via signal
- [x] Verification workflow (PENDING/VERIFIED/REJECTED) with audit-logged approve/reject, officer/admin-only queue (UI + Django Admin actions)
- [x] Bidder account suspend/reactivate (`account_status`), feeds `BidderProfile.is_eligible_to_bid`
- [x] Shared role & object-level permission helpers (`apps/accounts/permissions.py`) for later apps to reuse
- [x] Auction & category models, immutable `AuctionStatusLog`, full lifecycle state machine (`apps/auctions/services.py`) enforced server-side with row locking
- [x] Listing create/edit (DRAFT-only) with image upload (type/size validated), submit-for-review
- [x] Officer/admin approval queue — approve auto-advances to SCHEDULED, reject requires a reason, both audit-logged
- [x] Public browse/search + detail pages that only ever expose publicly-visible statuses (drafts 404 for non-owners)
- [x] Bid model (immutable, unique per-auction sequence numbers), server-authoritative `place_bid()` with row-locking (`select_for_update`) concurrency control
- [x] Business rules enforced server-side: minimum bid/increment, seller self-bid block, eligibility (verified + active), time-window check
- [x] Anti-sniping auto-extension (configurable per auction)
- [x] Privacy-preserving bid history (anonymized "Bidder A/B/C" labels; bidders see their own bids as "You"; staff see real usernames)
- [x] Automated closing (`close_auction`) with reserve-price logic and deterministic tie-breaking by sequence number, plus `invalidate_bid` for admin correction with recomputed highest-bid
- [x] Management commands `activate_scheduled_auctions` and `close_ended_auctions` for cron/Celery-beat scheduling — never triggered by a browser request
- [x] `Notification` model (in-app inbox, read/unread state, event type, optional link back to the triggering object)
- [x] `apps/notifications/services.notify()` as the single creation entry point — synchronous in-app row + async `deliver_notification` Celery task for any future email/SMS channel
- [x] Event coverage: outbid, auction won, auction closed with no winner, auction went live, listing approved/rejected, account verified/rejected, bidder suspended/reactivated
- [x] Inbox view + mark-one-read / mark-all-read endpoints, unread-count navbar badge via a context processor
- [x] `config/celery.py` wired up (Celery app instance, `django.conf:settings` config, autodiscovery)
- [x] Payments (status tracking only) — **Phase 8**
  - [x] `Payment` model, one row per won auction, auto-created the moment `close_auction` determines a winner
  - [x] `apps/payments/services.py`: `mark_paid` / `mark_failed` / `mark_refunded`, each requiring an `actor` and audit-logged
  - [x] `mark_paid` advances the auction CLOSED → SETTLED and notifies both buyer and seller
  - [x] Officer/admin payment-recording queue, plus read-only "my payments" (bidder) and "payments received" (seller) views
  - [x] No real payment gateway — method/reference are free-text fields an officer fills in after confirming payment out-of-band
- [ ] Disputes — **Phase 9**
- [ ] Reports & analytics — **Phase 10**
- [ ] Security hardening — **Phase 11**
- [ ] Test suite — **Phase 12**
- [ ] Deployment hardening — **Phase 13**

## Local setup (clone → running in minutes)

### Quickest: one click (Windows / Linux / macOS)

Double-click `start.bat` (Windows) or run `./start.sh`. It creates a virtual
environment, installs dependencies, writes `.env`, migrates, loads demo data,
starts the auction scheduler and the web server, and opens your browser. No
PostgreSQL or Redis needed. Needs Python 3.10+.

Log in at `/admin` as `seed_admin` / `Seed@12345`. Options: `--reset` (wipe the
database), `--no-seed`, `--no-browser`, `--port 8080`.

### Option A — plain Python + local Postgres & Redis

```bash
# 1. Clone and enter
git clone https://github.com/Goddy36-A/mbarara-auction.git
cd mbarara-auction

# 2. Virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate          # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# 4. Environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Open .env and set DATABASE_URL to point at your local Postgres

# 5. Create the database (if it doesn't exist yet)
createdb mbarara_auction           # or use pgAdmin / DBeaver

# 6. Migrate
python manage.py migrate

# 7. Create a superuser
python manage.py createsuperuser

# 8. Run
python manage.py runserver
```

Visit http://localhost:8000

> **Redis / Celery (optional for basic local use)**
> Notifications are written synchronously to the DB — the Celery task only
> handles future email/SMS channels. You can skip Redis locally and the site
> still works. If you want Celery running:
> ```bash
> # terminal 1 — make sure Redis is installed: sudo apt install redis-server
> redis-server
> # terminal 2
> celery -A config worker --loglevel=info
> ```

---

### Option B — Docker (no local Postgres/Redis needed)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Goddy36-A/mbarara-auction.git
cd mbarara-auction
cp .env.example .env
docker-compose up --build
docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Visit http://localhost:8000

---

## Demo / seed data

Populate a fresh database with sample users, categories, auctions in every
lifecycle state, bids and payments:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py seed_data            # password defaults to Seed@12345
python manage.py seed_data --password "YourDemoPass1!"
```

All accounts share that password: `seed_admin` (superuser), `officer_moses`,
sellers `seller_agnes` / `seller_david` / `seller_rose` / `seller_pending`, and
bidders `bidder_john` / `bidder_sarah` / `bidder_isaac` / `bidder_mary` /
`bidder_emma` / `bidder_pending` / `bidder_suspended`. It is idempotent (safe to
re-run) and refuses to run when `DEBUG=False` unless you pass `--force`.

## Running tests

```bash
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=config.settings.testing python manage.py test
```

---

## Scheduled tasks (auction activation & closing)

Two management commands drive auction timing — meant to run every minute
via cron or Celery beat (Phase 11):

```bash
python manage.py activate_scheduled_auctions   # SCHEDULED -> LIVE
python manage.py close_ended_auctions          # LIVE -> CLOSED, determines winner
```

---

## Deploy to Render

A `render.yaml` Blueprint is included. To deploy:

1. Push this repo to GitHub (already done at `Goddy36-A/mbarara-auction`)
2. Go to [render.com](https://render.com) → New → **Blueprint**
3. Connect GitHub → pick this repo
4. Render reads `render.yaml` and creates: web service + Celery worker + Postgres + Redis
5. Set `EMAIL_HOST_USER` and `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD` manually in the Render dashboard

## Contributing

- Business rules belong in a service layer, not in views or templates.
- Every bid/auction-state decision must be validated server-side.
- Run `flake8` before committing; keep migrations checked in.
